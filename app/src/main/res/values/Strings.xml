                            warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their

                            Using Creative Commons Public Licenses\n\n

                            Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
                            conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
                            original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
                            and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
                            following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
                            exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n

                                 Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
                                 intended for use by those authorized to give the public
                                 permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
                                 copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
                                 irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
                                 and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
                                 Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
                                 applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
                                 material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
                                 material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
                                 licensed material, or material used under an exception or
                                 limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

                                 Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
                                 licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
                                 licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
                                 the licensor\'s permission is not necessary for any reason--for
                                 example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
                                 copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
                                 licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
                                 other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
                                 the licensed material may still be restricted for other
                                 reasons, including because others have copyright or other
                                 rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
                                 such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
                                 Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
                                 respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

                            Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n


                            Section 1 -- Definitions.\n\n

                                      Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
                                      License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
                                      its terms and conditions.\n\n

                                   3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section

                                      simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)

                                   5. Downstream recipients.\n\n

                                        a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every

                                           Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                                           Public License.\n\n

                                           apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                                           Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                                           Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                                           Material.\n\n

                                   6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
                                      may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You

                                      with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
                                      the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as

                                   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not

                                      assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
                                      extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
                                      Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n

                                   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
                                      Public License.\n\n

                                   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
                                      collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
                                      Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
                                      under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
                                      licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
                                      reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n

                                 to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial

                                 Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n

                              c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
                                 all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\n

                            For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
                            replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
                            Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n

                                 USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
                                 ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
                                 DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
                                 IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n

                              c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
                                 above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
                                 possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
                                 waiver of all liability.\n\n


                            Section 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n

                              a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
                                 Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
                                 this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
                                 terminate automatically.\n\n

                              b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
                                 Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n

                                   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
                                      it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
                                      violation; or\n\n

                                   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n

                                 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
                                 right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
                                 of this Public License.\n\n

                              c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
                                 Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
                                 distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
                                 will not terminate this Public License.\n\n

                              d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
                                 License.\n\n


                            Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n

                              a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
                                 terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n

                              b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
                                 Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
                                 independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n


                            Section 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n

                              a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
                                 shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
                                 conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
                                 be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n

                              b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
                                 deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
                                 minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
                                 cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
                                 without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
                                 conditions.\n\n

                              c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
                                 failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
                                 Licensor.\n\n

                              d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
                                 as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
                                 that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
                                 processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n
